    # This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
    # package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
    # users can install this project, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
    #
    # There are some restrictions on what makes a valid project name
    # specification here:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name
    name='django-notification-system',  # Required

    # Versions should comply with PEP 440:
    # https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/
    #
    # For a discussion on single-sourcing the version across setup.py and the
    # project code, see
    # https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/single_source_version.html
    version='1.2.0',  # Required

    # This is a one-line description or tagline of what your project does. This
    # corresponds to the "Summary" metadata field:

    long_description_content_type='text/markdown',

    # This should be a valid link to your project's main homepage.

    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:
    #
    #   py_modules=["my_module"],
    #
    packages=find_packages(include=['django_notification_system', 'django_notification_system.*']),  # Required

    # This field lists other packages that your project depends on to run.
    # Any package you put here will be installed by pip when your project is
    # installed, so they must be valid existing projects.
